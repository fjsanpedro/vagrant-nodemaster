vagrant-nodemaster
==================
This plugin allows you to control centralizely remote virtual environments configured with the plugin [Vagrant-Node](https://github.com/fjsanpedro/vagrant-nodemaster/tree/master/lib/vagrant-node).


This plugin has been developed in the context of the [Catedra SAES](http://www.catedrasaes.org) of the University of Murcia(Spain).

##Installation
Requires Vagrant 1.2 and libsqlite3-dev

```bash
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-nodemaster
```

##Usage
This plugin provides two main commands: `vagrant remote` and `vagrant node`.

The command `Vagrant node` allows you to manage a set of computers as *nodes*. This set is composed by the an id of the node, the ip address/dns name and the port where it is listening.

This command is composed by the following subcommands:

* `vagrant node add <node-name> <node-address> <node-port> --hostname`:
Adds a node identified by node-name, with the ip node-address (or dns name if `--hostname` parameter is present) and the node-port where the node is listening.

* `vagrant node remove [node-name] --clean`: Removes a node identified by its *node-name* from the set of nodes. Also you can use the parameter --clean to remove all nodes from the list.

* `vagrant node update <node-name> <node-address> <node-port> --hostname`: Updates the information of the node identified by its *node-name*.

* `vagrant node updatepw <node-name> --remote`: Updates the password stored locally to login into the node. Furthermore you can update the password in the node using the `--remote`option.

* `vagrant node status`: Shows the list of nodes and its status, e.g. if they are listening.

* `vagrant node list`: Shows the list of nodes and its configurations

* `vagrant node operation last <node-name>`: Shows the last operations performed in the nodes and its result.

* `vagrant node operation show <node-name> <operation-id>`: Shows the result of the operation with the identifier operation-id.


The command `Vagrant remote` enables you to execute in remote nodes those commands that you can use locally. Also, some new ones have been added. Commands are performed, by default, asynchronous.

* `vagrant remote box`
 * `vagrant remote box add <node-name> <box-name> <url> [--synchronous]`: Executes `vagrant box add <box-name> <url>` in node identified by *node-name*.

 * `vagrant remote box list <node-name>`: Executes `vagrant box list` in node identified by *node-name*.

 * `vagrant remote box remove <node-name> <box-name> <box-provider>`: Executes `vagrant box remove <box-name> <box-provider>` in node identified by *node-name*.

* `vagrant remote destroy <node-name> [vm_name] [--force]`: Executes `vagrant destroy [vm_name] [--force]` in node identified by *node-name*.

* `vagrant remote halt <node-name> [vm_name] [--force] [--synchronous]`: Executes `vagrant halt [vm_name] [--force]` in node identified by *node-name*.

* `vagrant remote provision <node-name> [vm_name] [--synchronous]`: Executes `vagrant provision [vm_name]` in node identified by *node-name* .

* `vagrant remote resume <node-name> [vm_name] [--synchronous]`: Executes `vagrant resume [vm_name]` in node identified by *node-name* .

* `vagrant remote status <node-name> [vm_name]`: Executes `vagrant status [vm_name]` in node identified by *node-name*.

* `vagrant remote up <node-name> [vm_name] [--synchronous]`: Executes `vagrant up [vm_name]` in node identified by *node-name*.

* `vagrant remote suspend <node-name> [vm_name] [--synchronous]`: Executes `vagrant suspend [vm_name]` in node identified by *node-name*.

* `vagrant remote ssh <node-name> <vm_name>`: Executes `vagrant ssh <vm_name>` in node identified by *node-name*. This command enables you to connect by ssh to every vm in remote nodes.


* `vagrant remote snapshot` (New command)

 * `vagrant remote snapshot take <node-name> <vmname> <name> [description] [--synchronous]`: Takes a snapshot of the current state of the virtual machine *vmname* in remote node *node-name*. This snapshot is identified by *name* and optionally can have a *description*.

 * `vagrant remote snapshot restore <node-name> <vmname> <snapshot-uuid|snapshot-name]> [--synchronous]`: Restores the snapshot identified by its *snapshot-uuid* or by its *snapshot-name* of the virtual machine *vmname* in remote node *node-name*.

 * `vagrant remote snapshot list <node-name> [vmname]`: Shows the list of snapshots of the virtual machine *vmname* in remote *node-name*. This list also shows the current snapshot that is in use.


* `vagrant remote backup` (New command)

 * `vagrant remote backup take [node-name] [vmname] [--download target_directory][--background]`: This command allows you to make a backup of the virtual machine *vmname* in remote node *node-name*. This backup includes all the virtual machine images, and it is stored in a fixed place of the remote node. Also you can use the parameter `--download` to download the backup at the same time that is is taking. With parameter `--background`, this operation is donde in background.
 
 * `vagrant remote backup log <node-name> [vmname]`: Shows the log of backup operations done in virtual machine *vmname* in remote node *node-name*.
 

* `vagrant remote config` (New command)

 * `vagrant remote config addvm <node-name> <vm_config_file> [--rename]`: Adds the machines configured in `vm_config_file`to the remote node. To avoid name collision you can use the `--rename` option to rename them automatically.

 * `vagrant remote config deletevm <node-name> <vm_name> [--remove]`: Deletes the machine with name `vm_name`from the remote node config file. Also, if the parameter `--remove` is used, all the virtual machine information and data will be removed.

 * `vagrant remote config show <node-name>`: Downloads the remote node config file.

 * `vagrant remote config upload <node-name> <config_file>`: Uploads a config file to the remote node overwritting the current one.
